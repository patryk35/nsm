Problemy na frontendzie:
//TODO(medium): JWT token/session token should be refreshed if user try to use it just after token expire (e.g. up to 1 minute)
//TODO(medium): new mechanism of session:
  -sesion key ( key generated for x seconds or if rememberMe for longer period) - cached in db and jwt token
  -jwt token for 5-15 minutes with session key stored - jwt refresh has to be added (e.g. refresh if sessionkey not expired)
  - conception for it:
    . create field sessionkey one-to-many in User entity
    . each session kesy has expire time value
    . every 5-15 minutes new jwt token with session key
    . if user is active 5 minutes before session should be exipired -> change exipre time, e.g. add next 30 minutes
    . token has to be refreshed ~ 30seconds before expires - required frontend mechanism for it and endpoit for refresh
